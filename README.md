Simple scripts for fun and function created during my python learning journey. 

# Journey Notes
I learned about Python via Automate the Boring Stuff with Python while employed at Deepgram. Most of my early coding work and learning came from my work as a Program Manager specializing in Quality Assurance and understanding quality metrics. Due to this, and as you can imagine, all of my coding work is IP that belongs to Deepgram. Restarting with an empty Github is both daunting and exciting. I have the opportunity to build goofy, fun, little things for me. Some of them are even practical! 

While this repo won't receive many updates since these are all one off scripts that I used to automate some functional work, please check out some of my other projects and just for fun things I've been building.
